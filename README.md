# DegreeDayDA
Data assimilation in a degree-day snowmelt model.

## Currently implemented DA schemes
- Ensemble Kalman-based schemes
	- [x] Ensemble smoother
	- [x] Iterative ensemble smoother (ES-MDA)

## TO DO

- Add particle-based schemes and MCMC.
- Investigate different approaches to propagate information in space so as to update snowpack states in unobserved locations.
